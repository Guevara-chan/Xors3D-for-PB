##/Sum/:
**Xors3D** is an abandoned 3D graphics engine, easily accessible from almost any programming language through transparent procedural interface. It was initially developed by XorsTeam as attempt of bringing DirectX9 functionality into Blitz3D. Discounted since 2012.

**Xors3D for PureBasic** was one of first pre-official wrappers, reconstructed directly from Blitz3D headers.  
Just `XIncludeFile "Xors3D.pbi"` to hook it up - maximum transparency, PB style.

##/Featurae/:
+ 69 original Xors3D samples, translated from different sources to PureBasic.  
+ Latest salvageable Xors3D revision: *1.15.750.0*  
+ Dynamical prototype-based bindings.  
+ XCopy-based installation.  

##/Breakdown/:
**Graphix:** DirectX: 9.0c (*d3dx9_36.dll+* required)  
**Physix:** integrated (*xPhysics v1.15.750.0*)  
**Audio:** Squall sound system (version unknown)
